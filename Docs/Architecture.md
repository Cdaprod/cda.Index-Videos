Given the constraints and requirements you've outlined, it's clear you're aiming for a distributed architecture where each component plays a specific role. Here's how you could go about implementing the extractions and functions, taking into account your specific needs:

### Architecture Overview:

1. **Synology NAS**: Stores video files.
2. **Flask Server**: Serves video files from the Synology NAS.
3. **Desktop**: Performs data analysis and processing.
4. **Supabase**: Stores index of video source paths.
5. **Weaviate**: Primary database for AI Video App.

### Implementation Steps:

#### Flask Server (Synology NAS):

1. Continue using Flask to serve video files. The Flask server will act as a gateway between the Synology NAS and the rest of the system.
2. The API should be designed to fetch video paths from Supabase and then serve the actual files from the Synology NAS.

#### Data Processing Agent (Desktop):

1. This agent will be responsible for metadata and frame extraction.
2. Use a job scheduler to periodically scan the video index in Supabase and pull new or updated entries.
3. Fetch the videos from the Synology NAS through the Flask API for processing.
4. Perform metadata and frame extraction, and any other heavy computational tasks, on this Desktop.

#### Supabase:

1. Only store the minimal index data needed to identify and locate each video in the Synology NAS.
2. Could also store job statuses to help the Data Processing Agent decide which videos need processing.

#### Weaviate:

1. Store rich metadata, multiple types of embeddings, and other AI-generated insights here.
2. Implement query engines for metadata-generation, classification, NLP-QnA, similarity, contextual searches, etc.

#### AI Video Retrieval Agent:

1. This agent will handle queries and return relevant video files or metadata.
2. It will interact mainly with Weaviate for data retrieval and the Flask API for video file retrieval.

#### Data Extraction and Object Detection Agent:

1. This could be an extension of your Data Processing Agent or a separate agent depending on your needs.
2. This agent will handle object detection in video frames and other data extraction tasks.

### Passive Income Side Quest:

This could be commercialized as a powerful local video management and analysis solution. You could offer features like automated tagging, object recognition, and advanced search capabilities as premium features.

# How much money can I make if it is a SUCESS!

Pricing for a service like yours can be quite variable and depends on a number of factors including your target audience, feature set, and the problem you're solving. However, here's a rough guideline considering you're aiming for a specialized, mid-to-high-end service:

### Pricing Tiers

#### Basic Tier
- **Features**: Basic video retrieval, simple metadata search.
- **Target Audience**: Small businesses, individual users.
- **Price Range**: $300 - $500/year.

#### Professional Tier
- **Features**: Advanced search capabilities, automated tagging, limited AI-powered features like basic analytics.
- **Target Audience**: Mid-size organizations, video content creators.
- **Price Range**: $800 - $1,200/year.

#### Enterprise Tier
- **Features**: Full AI capabilities, custom analytics, priority support, API access.
- **Target Audience**: Large organizations with complex needs.
- **Price Range**: $2,500 - $5,000/year or more based on customization and support needs.

### Add-ons
- **Object Detection**: $200 - $500/year.
- **Custom Analytics Dashboard**: $500 - $1,000/year.
- **Priority Support**: $300 - $500/year.

### One-Time Fees
- **Setup Fee**: $100 - $500 based on customization.
- **Custom Development**: Variable, based on the scope of work.

### Passive Income Side Quest:

You could offer the AI toolkit as a standalone product or as an additional feature in one of the higher-priced tiers. This would not only add another layer of utility to your service but also offer another avenue for revenue.

Remember, these are just ballpark figures and the actual pricing can vary based on your costs, the value you provide, and what the market is willing to pay. I recommend conducting market research and possibly starting with a beta phase at discounted rates to gauge customer interest and willingness to pay.
