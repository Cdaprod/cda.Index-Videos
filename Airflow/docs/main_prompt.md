**Ansible**: Begin with the Ansible configurations. Set up the roles and playbook. The `main.yml` in the `roles/tasks` directory lays out the tasks to be performed, while `playbook.yml` orchestrates the entire deployment. This ensures the machines are provisioned and ready for the subsequent tasks.

**Terraform**: With the infrastructure defined in Ansible, the next step is to use Terraform for resource provisioning. `main.tf` will define the required resources like VMs, storage, and networking. Use `vars.tf` to keep track of any required variables such as API keys or resource IDs. The `outputs.tf` is there to provide feedback post-provisioning, showing details like IP addresses of the created resources. This stage provides the base for deploying the services on the cloud platforms of choice.

**Airflow**: Once infrastructure is set, Airflow comes into play. The `dags/` directory will contain Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) definitions, defining the workflow of tasks. The `plugins/` folder is vital for extending Airflowâ€™s features, and this is where the integration with tools like Weaviate and other data sources will be defined. Each node, be it master or worker, has its configurations set in the Airflow directories.

**Papermill**: With the workflows in place, Papermill is used for executing Jupyter notebooks. Store the notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory. Implement notebook execution logic and pipelines in `execute_notebook.py`. This script reads notebooks, fills them with appropriate parameters and executes them. Papermill serves as the bridge between raw data (or tasks like video analysis) and the actionable tasks defined in Airflow DAGs.

**Integrations**: Finally, the custom APIs and integrations tie everything together. Use the SDKs or client libraries for Weaviate, Supabase Postgres, Airtable API, and any other needed custom API pipelines. These integrations will often be found within Airflow plugins or directly in the tasks being run by Papermill in the notebooks.
